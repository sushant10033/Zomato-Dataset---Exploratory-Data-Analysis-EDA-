# Zomato-Dataset---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
# Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to derive insights into restaurant trends, pricing, customer ratings, and other key factors. The analysis helps understand the factors affecting restaurant success and customer preferences.


# The dataset contains various attributes related to restaurants, including:

1.Restaurant Name

2.Location

3.Ratings

4.Number of Reviews

5.verage Cost for Two

6.Cuisines Served

7.Online Order Availability

8.Delivery Service

# Goals of Analysis

1.Understand the distribution of restaurant ratings and their correlation with pricing.

2.Identify the most popular cuisines and restaurant locations.

3.Analyze customer review patterns and online order trends.

4.Detect missing values and handle outliers effectively.

5.Provide key insights through visualizations.

# Technologies Used

-Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and preprocessing.

-Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.

-upyter Notebook for structured analysis and documentation.

# Key Findings

1.High-rated restaurants often have a moderate price range, indicating affordability plays a crucial role.

2.ertain cuisines are more popular in specific locations, showing regional preferences.

3.Restaurants offering online delivery tend to have more reviews, highlighting customer engagement.



# Future Scope
